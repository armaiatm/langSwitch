Because ‘akuo’ was supposed to be שלום — a simple AHK applet to fix Hebrew/English layout slips.

This AutoHotkey script saves you from retyping when you accidentally type in the wrong keyboard layout (Hebrew ↔ English). 
Simply select the mistaken text and press CTRL+SHIFT+L - the script will convert it into the other language, 
preserving your original input while fixing the layout error.

No more backspacing entire sentences just because your keyboard was in the wrong mode. Lightweight, fast, and frustration-proof.

.exe is a compiled version.
.ahk file is the source, requires installation of AutoHotKey to run. AutoHotKey is at https://www.autohotkey.com/
